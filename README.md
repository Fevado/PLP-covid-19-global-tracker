# 🦠 COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

A Python data analysis project that tracks and visualizes the global spread of COVID-19 using real-world data. This project highlights key metrics such as total cases, deaths, vaccination progress, and more — across selected countries over time.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Import and clean COVID-19 global data from a reliable source.
- Analyze time trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations.
- Compare the pandemic's impact across multiple countries.
- Visualize key trends using charts and an optional choropleth map.
- Summarize findings with narrative insights.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python 3**
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) – Data loading and manipulation
- [numpy](https://numpy.org/) – Numerical operations
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) – Static plotting
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) – Enhanced visualization
- [plotly.express](https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/) – Interactive choropleth map

### 🔍 Insights & Reflections
-- The United States recorded the highest number of cases and deaths.

-- India exhibited significant spikes indicating multiple pandemic waves.

-- Kenya showed lower case numbers, possibly due to underreporting.

-- Death rates decreased over time, possibly due to vaccine availability and improved treatment.

-- Vaccination progress had a strong visual impact on recovery trends in several countries.

-- This project demonstrates the power of Python in real-world data analysis and highlights the global disparities in handling the pandemic.
